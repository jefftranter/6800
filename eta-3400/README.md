This is the monitor source code listing for the Heathkit ETA-3400
Memory and Input/Output Accessory for the ET-3400 and ET-3400A
Trainers. It was based on the listing in the Heathkit manual, adapted
for the "crasm" 6800 assembler. It also includes the code for the
Pittman Tiny BASIC ROM and a port (untested) of the Motorola MikBug
monitor.
