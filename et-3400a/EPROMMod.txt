The ET-3400A used a masked ROM that was compatible with, and could be
replaced by, a 2716 EPROM which is still readily available and can be
programmed by the user with a suitable programmer.

However, the ET-3400 used a MCM6830A ROM which has an entirely
different pinout from a 2716. You can rewire the socket as listed
below to allow using a 2716. As well as rewiring all the pins, a chip
select signal needed to be inverted, which can be done by adding a
74LS04 inverter ship.

You will have to cut the tracks to the original socket pins and wire
them to the changed signals. This is quite a job as all 28 pins were
involved and you will have to reconnect some tracks that go through
the pins.

The additional 74LS04 inverter can be mounted on a small board and
attached using double sided tape inside.

Note that the 2716 is a 2K EPROM and the original was 1K, so you only
need to program the upper half of the ROM.

I also confirmed that the circuit would work with a 2816 EEPROM, which
is an electrically erasable ROM chip that can be erased by the
programmer and not require a UV eraser.
