These are the programming files for the CPLD. It uses an Atmel
ATF16V8B emulating a 16V8 GAL.

Use the WINCUPL program to generate a JEDEC file from the files
6800sbc.pld and 6800sbc.si (or just use the provided file
6800sbc.jed).

The device can be programming using any suitable programmer. I use a
TL866IIPlus from XGecu.
