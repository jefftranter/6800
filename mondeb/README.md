This is a the MONDEB monitor debugger, written by Don Peters and
described in the book "MONDEB, An Advanced M6800 Monitor Debugger".

I typed in the listing from the book and adapted it to build with the
crasm cross-compiler. I have confirmed that it produces binary output
identical to the one in the book, but I have no hardware that can run
it so I cannot verify that it works.

To use the code or port it to another computer, you will want to
obtain a copy of the book.
